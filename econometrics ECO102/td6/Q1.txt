1.    Why a simple OLS regression of child mortality on pollution would lead to a biased estimation?

There exist ommitted variables which affect both mortality and pollution. The error they yield is quite large

2.    A common IV strategy for pollution is to use regulation, why would it lead to a weak first stage?

The problem arises due to the flaws of the regulations imposed

3.    The authors argue that the external validity of the results found in developed countries is low. 
      Why? Would we over- or under-estimate the real effect if we were to use the coefficients find in developed/less polluted countries?

There are arguments for both the underestimation and overestimation cases. The problem is that the correlation between pollution and mortality will likely not look the same (as a function) in developed countries as opposed to developing countries.


4.    Instead of running a simple OLS regression, the authors suggest to add month and month-area fixed effect. 
      Why does it improve the quality of the estimation?

By adding a monthly area fixed effects to the regression, because of Mexico's high variance in pollution over time, we can observe the effect of pollution on mortality for a wide range of magnitudes (levels of pollution)


5.    The authors suggest using thermal inversion as an instrument for air pollution. 
      Discuss the exogeneity and the relevance conditions of this instrument.
