    "> Nicholas Constantine Metropolis is a Greek-American physicist. In the 1950s, a group of researchers led by Metropolis, including John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam, developed the Monte Carlo method. This term describes a broad class of algorithms relying on random sampling. The basic idea is to use randomness to solve deterministic problems. These kind of methods are now widely used, for instance in optimization, integration and probability."
