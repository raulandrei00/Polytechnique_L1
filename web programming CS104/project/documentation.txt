functionalities
    canvas tools: ...
    
    save option: the user can save their current work by clicking the save button
    the image is converted to a JSON file and stored in an array that is later accessed by the dashboard
    
    dashboard: the user can browse through their saved work and reopen any piece they want to continue editing
    when the user clicks on a certain canvas, a new notebook.html instance is opened

    sign in and log in: the infrastructure allows creation and use of several 
    accounts each keeping their particular settings and work
    this works by storing each username and password in the local memory as well 
    as the current logged in user. This way, when the user attempts to save their work, 
    it is saved directly in a JavaScript array specific to them (their username and password)
    the dashboard similarly shows canvases from their specific array.
